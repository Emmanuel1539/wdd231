        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to develop a website for an agricultural organization that specializes in offering a range of services including consultancy, 
        farm setup, equipment leasing, and investment opportunities for different crops like cassava, vegetables, groundnut, and plantain farming 
        to help people who have an interest in farming but do not have the luxury of time to participate in it. 
        It will also help farmers manage and maximize their farm output through our consultancy services and equipment leasing.  
        The website will provide detailed information about these services and allow visitors to subscribe to any of the services of their interest.</p>
